# TEOS Governance Model

This document describes how governance decisions are created, validated, and finalized within the TEOS framework.

---

## Governance Lifecycle

1. Proposal submission
2. Schema validation
3. Validator eligibility checks
4. Voting period
5. Quorum and weight evaluation
6. Final decision recording
7. Audit artifact generation

---

## Voting Model

- Voting power is weighted by role and validator status
- Quorum thresholds are explicitly defined per proposal type
- All votes are deterministic and reproducible

---

## Audit Guarantees

- All decisions are traceable
- Inputs, votes, and outcomes are verifiable
- Governance logic is transparent and reviewable

---

This model ensures TEOS governance remains **civic-first, sovereign, and audit-ready**.
