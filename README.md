## Governance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa establishes governance first.  
Institutions enforce policy.  
Technology executes under authority.

No blockchain, AI system, DAO, or protocol may override
human, institutional, or sovereign governance.
